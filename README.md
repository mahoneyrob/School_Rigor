# School_Rigor

In this project, I analyzed the overall rigor of the school, comparing acheivement data over the last 15 years.  Data analyzed included entrance exam scores, SAT scores, college admissions, and grades.  Data was comipled with SQL, and cleaned with python's pandas library.  Plots were made with matplotlib in a jupyter notebook with python.

### Due to privacy concerns, only the code used to run the analysis has been uploaded, but have included a zoomed in screen shot of one of the visuals.
